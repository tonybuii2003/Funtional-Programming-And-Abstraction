     Performs the binary operation, as defined by the group, of one object with the other specified object. The
     implementer must take care to ensure that the binary operation is
     * <ul>
     *     <li><b>closed</b> for the parameter type <code>T</code>. That is, the result of the binary operation is a
     *     valid member of the set that defines the type <code>T</code> (taking the denotational semantics view of data
     *     types). For example, addition is a binary operation that is closed for integers, but division is not.</li>
     *     <li><b>associative</b>. That is, for any elements <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> in this
     *     group, <code>binaryOperation(binaryOperation(x, y), z)</code> is equal to
     *     <code>binaryOperation(x, binaryOperation(y, z))</code>. For example, addition is an associative binary
     *     operation for integers.</li>
     *     <li>respectful of the identity element. That is, for any element <code>x</code> in this group and the
     *     identity element <code>e</code> of this group, <code>binaryOperation(x, e)</code> is equal to <code>x</code>,
     *     and <code>binaryOperation(e, x)</code> is also equal to <code>x</code>. For example, <code>0</code> is the
     *     identity element of the group of integers under addition.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param one   the object that is the first argument of the binary operation.
     * @param other the other object (the second argument of the binary operation) to be combined with this object as
     *              per the group's binary operation.
     * @return the result of the binary operation on this object with the other specified object.
